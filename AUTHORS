GPoSTTL is an enhanced version of Brill's rule-based
Parts-of-Speech  Tagger,  with  in-built  Tokenizer  and
Lemmatizer. It is based on LPost package by Jimmy Lin
(jimmylin at umd.edu). LPost itself it based on Benjamin
Han's ePost package which is a cleaned-up version of Brill's
original code.  The lemma list is based on e_lemma.txt
(Ver.1), complied by Yasumasa Someya (someya at
someya-net.com).
